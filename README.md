# Game Review Comparison
## Overview
The **Game Review Comparison Dashboard** aggregates and compares ratings from multiple game review platforms to provide a more balanced, data-driven perspective on video game quality.

Rather than relying on a single review source, this dashboard consolidates scores across multiple platforms, highlights rating trends, and identifies discrepancies between sites. The objective is to:

- 📊 Deliver a more **unbiased overall rating**
- 🔍 Reveal **rating inconsistencies and outliers**
- 🚩 Identify potentially unreliable or biased review sites
- 📈 Provide clear visual comparisons for better decision-making

By analysing patterns across review platforms, the dashboard helps distinguish between genuine critical consensus and skewed or anomalous scoring.

## Why This Matters

Game reviews can vary significantly depending on scoring systems, editorial policies, audience demographics, and platform preferences. A single score rarely tells the full story.

This dashboard promotes transparency by making differences measurable and visible, helping users make informed decisions based on aggregated data rather than isolated opinions.

Whether you're:
- 🎮 A gamer deciding on your next purchase  
- 🧠 A data enthusiast analysing review trends  
- 🏢 A developer assessing market perception  

This tool provides structured insight beyond individual reviews.
